# Assembl√©:

Is a project board for dancers that enables them to post music that they want to choreograph to, post video of choreographers that they admire, and post video of dance teams that they admire.

Why I made it:
When I was part of the dance community, I wished that there would be an app where I can store all of my dance related videos and store music that I want to choreograph to. Unfortunately, what ended up happening is that I would forget a lot of the names of the video and the names of the songs. Since the current and previous unit deals with database, making that app is possible.

Process:
At the beginning of the project, I have to re-learn React again because I unfortunately didn't quite understood the materials completely. Personally I think React would be a wonderful tool only if we know how to use it. The most frustrating part of React is the fact that for whatever reason, CSS file from one component affects other components from completely different page. It took me a long time to get used to that, and I'm still not quite sure if I did it correctly. Database might be a little easier in comparison to Mongo/Mongoose, but since I ran out of time and my attempt at connecting the CRUD from tutorial to my page failed multiple times, I unfortunately could not fulfil that requirements.

End:
In the end, I unfortunately cannot get my CRUD to work, but I do have oAuth using firebase. For presentation I have to use hard code to show what my app could have done had everything work perfectly.
